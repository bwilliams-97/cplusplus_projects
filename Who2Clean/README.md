# Who2Clean

This project is for creating a task rota (perhaps between housemates...). It makes use of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) to generate an interactive GUI. 
The user can enter a set of individuals (and their laziness), as well as a set of tasks.

A rota is computed for a chosen number of iterations and saved to csv.
